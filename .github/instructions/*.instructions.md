In the kontrol-db-core module the following sub-packages are key
* `modelchange` package contains a data class that maps one-to-one to a SQL DDL change
* `core.generator` package contains the code to map the modelchange data class into raw SQL statements (usually a single statement with method `convertSingle`) but can generate a list of SQL statements by overriding `convert`

The generators in kontrol-db-core will be used by default for all database types. But its possible to define a generator in one of the other subprojects to provide database-specific SQL generators that are not standard. These will take precedence over the ones in core.
The `integrationTest` module contains a set of tests that will be executed against every database subproject using docker to provide a real target database. 
For this reason unit tests in each module are not required, but you can run `gradlew :kontrol-db-oracle:integrationTest` to run tests for Oracle and follow the same convention for other database types.
